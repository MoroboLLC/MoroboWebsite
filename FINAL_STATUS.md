## 🎯 **URL BEST PRACTICES - CONFIRMED**

### **✅ What We Did Right:**

1. **Clean URLs**
   - `/apps/indecision/` instead of `/apps/indecision/index.html`
   - `/privacypolicy/` instead of `/privacy-policy.html`
   - Professional and user-friendly

2. **SEO-Friendly**
   - Descriptive paths: `/apps/indecision/support/`
   - No file extensions visible
   - Easy to remember and share

3. **Consistent Structure**
   - `/apps/{app-name}/` - App landing
   - `/apps/{app-name}/support/` - Support
   - `/apps/{app-name}/privacypolicy/` - Privacy
   - Same pattern for both apps

4. **Backwards Compatible**
   - Old `.html` files still exist
   - Won't break existing bookmarks
   - Can be removed later if desired

### **URLs - Before:**

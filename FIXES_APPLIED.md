## üìã STILL NEEDED:

### 1. **Motonia Privacy Policy**

- Change emails to morobo.llc@gmail.com

### 2. **Legacy Support Pages**
- `apps/indecision/support.html` (old file)

### 3. **Test UI Issues**
- Verify Indecision app page displays correctly
- Verify Motonia app page displays correctly
- Verify support pages have proper styling (not black/white)

## üîç INVESTIGATION NEEDED:

**User reported:**
- Support page showing as "black and white" - needs visual inspection
- Indecision and Motonia pages "got messed up" - needs to check what broke
- Possible spacing/layout issues

**Likely causes:**
- CSS path might be broken (but paths look correct)
- Canvas background script might not be loading
- JavaScript file might have issues

## üìß EMAIL ADDRESSES:

**Correct email:** `morobo.llc@gmail.com`

**Previously used (incorrect):**
- ~~hello@morobo.com~~
- ~~privacy@morobo.com~~
- ~~support@morobo.com~~
- ~~motonia@morobo.com~~
